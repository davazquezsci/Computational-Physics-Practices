# Computational Physics Practices

This repository contains various computational physics programs using numerical methods. Each task is stored in its own folder with the following structure:

- **PDF (Practice)**: Explains the method and provides instructions.
- **Program**: Contains the code implementing the numerical method.

### How to use:
1. Open the **PDF** file first to understand the method and the practice.
2. Then, explore the corresponding **program** to see the implementation.
